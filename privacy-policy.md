## Use of WHOOP® Devices

Participants will be provided with WHOOP® wristbands that record real-time physiological signals, including heart rate, movement, and skin temperature. The wristbands will be worn:

- Daily for 21 days prior to psilocybin administration  
- Daily for 7 days following the dosing session  
- Continuously during the supervised psilocybin session  

These data are used to monitor autonomic and physiological changes before, during, and after the intervention.

## Device Assignments & Anonymity

Each WHOOP device is linked to a study-specific account using a non-personal email address created and managed by the research team. Participants will not use personal WHOOP accounts.

- Each participant will be assigned a device randomly using a unique study ID.  
- Devices will be reused across participants but never simultaneously.  
- Device tracking is logged by the study team to avoid data misattribution.  
- Only physiological data (e.g., heart rate, strain, temperature) is collected.

## Informed Consent

All participants will provide informed consent prior to any data collection:

- Participants will receive a detailed Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form outlining study procedures and data handling.  
- Preliminary consent is obtained electronically before telephone screening.  
- Full informed consent will be obtained via email prior to any study visit.  
- Participants may withdraw their consent at any time without penalty.

Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions and review the WHOOP® privacy policy prior to consenting to the use of the wearable.

## Data Collection & Storage

- The WHOOP app must be installed to allow physiological data to sync to WHOOP’s servers.  
- Participants will be guided to:
  - Disable app notifications  
  - Hide in-app metrics  
  - Opt out of any commercial tracking features within the app  

- Data will be retrieved using WHOOP’s API via secure Python scripts, and exported in CSV format.  
- Data will be stored:
  - On a secure UCL-managed server  
  - On a password-protected external hard drive stored in a locked facility accessible only by the Principal Investigator (PI)

Once all required data is exported and verified, the research team will submit a formal request to WHOOP to **permanently delete** all data from their servers.

Requests for deletion can be sent to WHOOP at:
- **Email:** support@whoop.com  
- **Phone:** +1 (833) 948-0566

## Participant Rights & Opt-Out Options

- Participants may opt out of using the WHOOP device at any point during the study.  
- Participants may choose to wear the device **only during in-person visits** if preferred.  
- Participants will be provided a copy of WHOOP’s commercial privacy policy [here](https://www.whoop.com/privacy/full-privacy-policy/) and may ask any questions.
